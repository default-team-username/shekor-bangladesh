# শেকড় (Shekor) - Protecting Food, Protecting Lives

## Project Overview: Reducing Food Loss in Bangladesh (SDG 12.3)

Shekor is a mobile-first application designed to combat the significant post-harvest food loss experienced in Bangladesh, particularly concerning staple crops and grains. By leveraging technology, we aim to provide farmers with timely, hyper-local risk predictions and actionable guidance to protect their harvest and secure their livelihoods.

### The Problem

Bangladesh loses approximately **4.5 million metric tonnes** of food grains annually, resulting in an economic cost of around **US $1.5 billion**. Inefficiencies, poor storage, and inadequate handling lead to 12–32% loss rates for staple foods. This challenge directly hinders progress toward **Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 12.3** (reducing food losses along production and supply chains).

### The Solution

Shekor provides an AI-powered crop management system that monitors storage conditions and predicts the Estimated Time to Critical Loss (ETCL), allowing farmers to intervene before spoilage occurs.

### Key Features Implemented (Part A - Pre-Hackathon)

1.  **Storytelling Landing Page (A1):** A bilingual (English/Bangla) landing page that highlights the food loss problem and visually demonstrates the solution workflow (Data → Warning → Action → Saved Food).
2.  **Farmer & Crop Management (A2):**
    *   Farmer registration and mock login system.
    *   Registration of new crop batches, including crop type, weight, harvest date, and storage details.
    *   A dashboard displaying active batches and a farmer score.
    *   A celebratory modal for the first batch registration.
3.  **Prediction & Risk Forecasting (A4 - Mock):** A simple logic model calculates the Estimated Time to Critical Loss (ETCL) based on input parameters (temperature, moisture) and provides human-readable guidance.
